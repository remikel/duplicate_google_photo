				<h2>This is <b>NOT</b> a Google Product</h2>
				<p>It's made by a kind developer named RÃ©mi Mikel who just want to share how he deleted all his
					duplicates on Google Photos.</p>
				<h3>Find your duplicates in Google Photos</h3>
				<p>Find them all and delete all. Save space, save the planet, save yourself.</p>
				<p>I had many duplicates because I uploaded pictures from google Drive and Save & Sync App.</p>
				<p>The delete feature from API doesn't exist for Google Photos and it's not planned yet.
					Waiting Google create a tool who delete duplicates, here's a good way to make it.
				</p>
				<p>Here is a video to explain how to do it :</p>
                <div class="video">
				    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULalSu3MPRE" frameborder="0"
					allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
					allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
				<h4>Let's start now and connect to your google photos ! None of your datas is saved anywhere. It's fully transparent, fully free, fully respect your anonymity.</h4>
				<p>
					<a class="gp-button raised" id="login" href="/connect">
						Connect to Google Photos
					</a>
				</p>
				<p>This app will connect to your google photos then access to all the pictures to read them, nothing will be modified or deleted.
					Then the app will help you to find the duplicated pictures and you can decide by yourself if you want to delete the manually.
					None of your datas will be used for anything by anyone. It's just a program who checks your duplicates.
